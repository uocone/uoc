# In mathematics
the mathematical problem of "trusted true random number" is solved, and a completely trusted device-independent true random number can be generated within "any agreed range". 

# At the consensus level
a new consensus mechanism “POG” (proof of game) was developed, which can liberate 99% of the computing power and form a node consensus with complete credibility, complete fairness, and high speed.

# In terms of resource description,
UOC first proposed the theory of “public resources”, which allowed blockchain technology to expand from a single currency to a large-scale Internet application in the description of the ownership of digital assets.

# At the script level,
the "aggregation contract" was developed to support the use of more than 100,000 contracts to write a large and complex complete decentralized application.

# At the data layer
a “self-certification storage chain” was developed to ensure the security and credibility of the massive data generated by the application when interacting.
